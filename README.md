## Hi there 👋
# I'm Shreya Rai

**Cybersecurity Student | Offensive Security Enthusiast**  
I’m a cybersecurity student with a strong hands-on interest in **Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (VAPT)**, **Incident Response**, **SIEM**, and **Threat Hunting**.  
I enjoy working close to real-world attack scenarios—analyzing traffic, hunting anomalies, and building security-first applications.

I believe security is not a feature, it’s a **mindset**.
